# tamos

## What does "tamos" stand for?
tamos stands for Thermal Architectures Modelling and Optimization Software.

## What is it?
tamos is a non-GUI tool that aims at facilitating the study of thermal architectures.  
A thermal architecture is a set of energy production, storage and distribution components that operate together in order to meet some energy demands.

## How does it work? 
tamos performs the optimal sizing and operation of various energy components gathered in energy hubs.  
It relies on the description of these components using the Mixed-Integer Programming formalism, i.e. mathematical programming.

## When will it be available?
Both source code and Python 3 packages will be available by the end of 2022.
